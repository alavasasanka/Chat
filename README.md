# Chat
A simple chat application for communication between offline vendors and users.

Offline vendors can register themselves by signing up as a vendor.

This application shows a list of products along with its online prices and it allows a user to bid on a product
which gets broadcasted to all registered offline vendors in the nearby region who could then reply back to the user.

Similarly, if a product is out of stock online, the user can request for its availability in the nearby area to which
any registered offline vendor in that vicinity could reply back if that particular product is available with them
and can negotiate on the price.

This application is built using Parse as backend.
